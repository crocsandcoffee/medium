# ContactListApp

## Summary

This sample app provides a working example of loading a user's full contact list, sorted by starred contacts, using Paging3 library. The loading of contacts in the background has been implemented in two different ways - one with coroutines and one with RxJava. This app follows MVVM architecture and leverages StateFlow to drive the UI state.
